    <h1>Happy Trails Travel Agency</h1>
    <h2>Welcome to our travel agency. We have various destinations to choose from and lots of options for everyone's preferences. 
        <br>
        Here are our picks for the top travel destinations:
        <p>
          <ul>
            <li>Turkey's Turquiose Coast</li>
            Sunshine-soaked and with a glittering blue seaboard, Turkey’s glorious “turquoise” coast wouldn’t normally rank as a newly rising star. The 300-mile loop of coastline that unfurls like an iridescent ribbon between Marmaris and Antalya has long been a favourite for holiday-makers, with UK visitors in particular flocking to its picture-perfect fishing villages and chic little bougainvillea-laden resorts.
            <li>Rwanda</li>
            Admire its mountain gorillas, a conservation success story that sees trekkers paying $1,500 (£1,120) a head for an hour-long, close encounter. It’s a well-organised and, at times, strenuous experience, but Rwanda is by no means just about apes.
